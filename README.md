# Competitive-Programming
All *solutions are from various competitive programming sites such as Leetcode, CodeWars, Topcoder, and Codeforces.

Some *solutions are from Cracking the Coding Interview by Gale McDowell.

*Solutions were solved solely by me. Any similiraties to an unknown source is probably just coincidence and will hurt my feelings if you assume I'd copy someones solution. :(
