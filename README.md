# Competitive-Programming
All *solutions are from various competitive programming sites such as Leetcode, CodeWars, Topcoder, and Codeforces.

Some *solutions are from Cracking the Coding Interview by Gale McDowell.

*All solutions were created by yours truly, however, feel free to use them for creative inspiration.
Solutions are added randomly, so coding style may change randomly; I don't want to tamper with my 
initial solutions as they provide insight for my own personal development. Thanks and enjoy!
